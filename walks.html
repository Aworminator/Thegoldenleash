                <p>At The Golden Leash, we bring personalized care directly to you! Our team will stop by to check on your dog and take them for a walk tailored to their needs. Each walk typically lasts around 45 minutes, giving your pup plenty of exercise and attention.
                    <br><br>
                Your dog's safety and well-being are our top priorities. That’s why we monitor the weather closely, ensuring your furry friend isn’t exposed to unsafe conditions. We avoid walks in temperatures below 28°F, and during extreme heat, we’ll adjust walk times to protect your dog’s paws from hot sidewalks.
                Because your dog deserves the very best care—rain, shine, or snow!</p>
