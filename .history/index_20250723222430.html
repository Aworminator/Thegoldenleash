          At The Golden Leash, our boarding service is truly cage-free—your dog
          enjoys a comfortable, home-like environment 24/7 with no kennels or
          crates. We believe every pup deserves freedom, companionship, and
          personalized attention, so they’re never confined and always part of
          the family. <br /><br />
          For dogs who prefer familiar surroundings, we also offer in-home
          boarding. Our trusted staff can stay at your home, ensuring your dog’s
          routine and comfort are maintained while you’re away. Whether at our
          place or yours, your dog receives loving care, playtime, and

          At The Golden Leash, our doggy daycare is a great environment where
          your pup can play, socialize, and relax just like at home. We believe
          dogs thrive when they’re free to interact and explore, so we provide
          supervised group play and plenty of space for every personality.
          <br /><br />
          Our experienced staff ensures each dog’s safety and comfort, offering
          personalized attention throughout the day. Whether your dog loves to
          romp with friends or prefers quiet time, we tailor their experience to
          meet their needs. Give your dog a fun, stress-free day—no cages, just
          care!

        <p>
          At The Golden Leash, we bring personalized care directly to you! Our
          team will stop by to check on your dog and take them for a walk
          tailored to their needs. Each walk typically lasts around 45 minutes,
          giving your pup plenty of exercise and attention. <br /><br />
          Your dog's safety and well-being are our top priorities. That’s why we
          monitor the weather closely, ensuring your furry friend isn’t exposed
          to unsafe conditions. We avoid walks in temperatures below 28°F, and
          during extreme heat, we’ll adjust walk times to protect your dog’s
          paws from hot sidewalks. Because your dog deserves the very best
          care—rain, shine, or snow!
