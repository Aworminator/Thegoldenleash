As the proud mom of Luke (her Hyena-like furball) and Clover (her lovable Black Lab), Alicia knows her way around a tail wag or two. When she’s not running the show, you’ll find her savoring a hot cup of tea, surrounded by friends and family, and enjoying a well-deserved Saturday chill session.</p></div>
