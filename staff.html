                <p>Alicia Stamper - The top dog <br>Alicia has been running The Golden Leash for over six years, and when she’s not busy caring for your pups, she’s baking up gourmet treats in her own doggy bakery.

When she’s not running the show, you’ll find her savoring a hot cup of tea, surrounded by friends and family, and enjoying a well-deserved Saturday chill session.</p>
